LXC support under Debian Squeeze is pretty good but there were still quite a few post-create tasks that I was always doing so here's a script to wrap it all up.

What it does
============

- Configures the container to start when the host boots up
- Configures the container to shutdown nicely when it gets a PWR signal from the host
- Configures network/interfaces for a given static IP address and generates a MAC based on the address


Things to do
============

- Un-hardcode the netmask, gateway and DNS settings. Work it out from the host network settings.
- Look for duplicate entries in the startup list
